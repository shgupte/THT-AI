Theta Tau Theta Gamma 
Iota Gamma Class 
Yearbook Pledge Project
Fall 2024
________________


Context
Y’all remember yearbooks right? Well that’s great because Theta Tau needs some superlatives handed out to showcase some of its exceptional brothers. We also need some dope collages that highlight the amazing events put on by our committees throughout the semester. So with that being said, let's make a yearbook!! (I know this was cringe but you get the point)


Task(s) 
Your task is to put together a yearbook that creatively documents important events and milestones that took place throughout the semester, along with assigning fun superlatives to deserving brothers. Your deliverables are:
1. Produce a comprehensive yearbook with a length of your choosing
2. Include numerous pictures from both pledge and brotherhood events from the semester
3. Assign a page of fun superlatives to deserving brothers (try to include their name and funny picture of the brother)


Tips 
1. Look at previous yearbooks, this ain’t that hard tbh
