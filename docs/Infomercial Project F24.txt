Theta Tau Theta Gamma 
Iota Gamma Class 
Infomercial Pledge Project
Fall 2024
________________


Context
Our rush video may be getting slightly old… so our social media team would love it if y'all could help create a refreshing styled rush video that can highlight how AWESOME our fine fraternity is. And what better way to advertise something than a good ole infomercial!! 


Task(s) 
Your task is to write, film, and produce an early 2000’s style informal infomercial about Theta Tau fraternity to be played at your final chapter. Your deliverables are: 
1. Produce a 5-7 minute long infomercial that showcases Theta Tau. 
2. Include sit-down testimonies from brothers (ideally one from each pc). 
3. Document your pledge experience. 


Tips 
1. Decide filming equipment and style ASAP (can ask older bros who have film experience for advice. ex. Diego Paredes, Max Burgida)
2. Contact brothers for testimonies early (maybe could even do them after interviews if you ask nicely)
3. Take lots of videos/photos during your pledging so you have content to edit
