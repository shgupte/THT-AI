Theta Tau Theta Gamma 
Iota Gamma Class 
Mechanical Engineering Pledge Project
Fall 2024
________________


Context
Our brotherhood currently lacks a staple in UM tailgate culture: a die table. Standard die tables are too large and bulky for our fraternity to invest in, and we do not have a designated house to store it at. Thus, your Mechanical Engineering (ME) project for this semester is to design and construct a foldable die table surface that can be placed on top of a standard folding table to be used for a die game. 


Task(s) 
Your task is to design, model, and build a functional folding die table top to be used at Theta Tau tailgates and other applicable events. Your deliverables are:
1. CAD die table top model
2. Constructed and painted die table top  


Die Table Top Requirements
1. Be able to fold in half for storage purposes 
2. Fit on a standard folding table 
3. Decorated in a way relevant to the fraternity or UM 
4. Can be hand-carried by any brother in the fraternity


Design Process
Research die tables, and meet with your team in order to brainstorm ideas and physically draw a design out. After that is done, you should ask for feedback from older/other bros (like bros in ME) and work on a CAD model. You will be presenting this CAD model at chapter for feedback, come prepared for constructive criticism. Once you have created a final CAD model, you will buy supplies, build, and decorate the thing. You will have $100ish to build this project. 


BE CREATIVE WITH IT!


Tips 
1. Start early 
2. Work together 
3. Consult older bros 
   1. Arielle & Rohan will be useful for this project
   2. Be respectful of older bros time when asking for help/advice. They are also full time students and are willing to help you out of the goodness of their hearts. Be mindful, polite, and patient.
