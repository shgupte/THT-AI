Requirements Details:
Interviews:
You are expected to complete at least 30 brother interviews this semester. Interviews are pledge driven conversations with brothers which serve as a great opportunity to get to know the brotherhood of Theta Tau. Each brother has their own preferred style of interview, but you should always approach them professionally. Furthermore, you should ask whether the brother wants you to take notes during or after the interview. To ensure you have adequate time talking to brothers, you should schedule google calendar invites of 1.5 hours per interview. Brothers should be the ones to end each interview, therefore let them know beforehand if you need to leave at a certain time. 


When reaching out to brothers for an interview, be proper and provide them with multiple times you are free. Here is a general template you should use to reach out to brothers:




“Hi brother! This is your name. I would love to interview you this week and was wondering if any of these times work for you?
LIST MULTIPLE AVAILABLE TIMES (3+)
Please let me know if any of these times work for you. Looking forward to speaking with you.” 






Short Signatures:
You must receive a short signature from every brother you did not interview unless otherwise stated by your pledge parents. Short signatures ensure that you personally get to know each brother in the fraternity to some extent. Feel free to ask brothers any questions you may have during these short signatures, however you are required to get the following information from the brother:


* Full name and explanation of their nickname (if applicable)
* Reason for their chosen major
* Year of graduation
* Where the brother is from
* One fun fact


Academic Hours:
You are expected to obtain 20 total academic hours. At least four of these hours must come from study tables (every Tuesday at 7PM) and at least four of these hours must come outside of study tables. Brothers are often in SUGLI (second floor of the UGLI), which is a great place to get academic hours. A maximum of three hours can be earned at a single time.


Social/Brotherhood Hours:
You are expected to obtain 20 total social/brotherhood hours. Social/Brotherhood hours can be obtained any time a pledge is with a brother outside of pledge meetings at required events. A maximum of three hours can be earned at a single time. 


Committee Sign-offs:
Some committees require you to obtain a sign-off. Read over the committee sign-off descriptions AS SOON AS POSSIBLE in order to plan accordingly. These descriptions can be found at the following link:
F24 Committee Sign-Offs Info


Social Event:
Your pledge class is responsible for organizing a social event for the chapter. You will have money budgeted for this event. Some past examples are cookie decorating, ice skating, poker night, and karaoke. 








Song and Dance:
As a pledge class you must perform a song and dance of “We Are the Theta Taus” to the brotherhood. You will be given the music and lyrics and will be tasked with choreographing a dance. 


Initiation Gathering:
Your pledge class is responsible for organizing the post-initiation ceremony. You will have money budgeted for this event
 
Professional Activities:
Professional development is an integral part of Theta Tau, a professional engineering fraternity. As such, we encourage our pledges to develop their professional skills by learning from brothers’ experiences. Every pledge must complete the following mock-recruiting process in order. 
1. Company Research (PD Big) - due 10/20
2. Resume and Cover Letter (PD Big) - due 10/27
3. Apply for a Job (PD Chair or PD Big) - due 11/3
4. Mock Interview (PD Big or Upperclassman in your Major) - due 11/17
5. 4 Year Class Plan (PD Big) - due 11/24
6. LinkedIn (PD Chair or PD Big) – due 1 week after LinkedIn Workshop 11/11
7. Alumni Panel (PD Chair) – due day of Alumni Panel


You should meet with your PD big at least twice during the semester. 
Meeting 1: Come prepared with your drafts of 1&2 done (have this meeting before 10/27)
Meeting 2: Mock interview, should have applied to a job after discussions from meeting, and should go over your 4 year class plan. (have this before 11/24) 
 
Mock-Recruiting Process
1. Company Research  (PD Big) - due 10/20
Choose an industry and research three different companies at three different sizes. From your research, create and present one-pagers (example below) to your PD big. In your one-pagers, you must at least answer the following questions.
* What do you like about the company and why?
* What roles are interesting to you?
* Which qualifications do you fulfill?
* What qualifications do you see that are important?
* How can you acquire these skills and qualifications?  
        Ex.


















   2. Resume and Cover Letter (PD Big) - due 10/27
Create a resume and cover letter on your own. Cover letters are tailored for a specific job application, so base your cover letter on one of the positions you found during your research. Samples of both resumes and cover letters can be found on the ECRC website, the PD presentation slides, or from an older brother in your major. After creating both documents, meet with an upperclassman brother for a critiquing session. This meeting should provide you with concrete feedback and direction on how to improve your resume and cover letter. Resumes can be highly subjective, so it is encouraged that you receive feedback from multiple trusted sources. You can always meet with PD Chair or PD big beyond your pledge requirements, including your time as a brother.


   3. Apply for a Job (PD Chair or PD Big)  - due 11/3
Applying for a job may seem like a straightforward task, but there are many nuances to it that are hard to identify before you have a lot of experience. Below we have listed the many ways to apply for a job and the pros and cons for each. Meet with a PD Chair or your PD big and complete any of the listed methods.
   * Online
Pros: Applying online through a company’s website, or through other job portals such as Indeed, Handshake, or LinkedIn is a quick and simple way to get your resume out there. By applying to a couple every night, you can easily apply to 100+ companies during the recruiting cycle.
Cons: Resumes that are not formatted well or lack critical keywords will be automatically disregarded. Also, given how many people apply online, the chance of a person reading your resume is low.
   * Career Fair/Recruiting Event (does not require PD Chair/Mentor presence)
Pros: This is the best way to gain face-time with a recruiter and sell yourself in-person. Recruiters may also set up interviews with you immediately if there is interest. If you do not have much content on your resume, this is a great opportunity to let your passion for an industry or company shine through. 
Cons: Talking to recruiters can be intimidating and is a skill that everyone has to work on. Start going to career fair as early as possible to front-load your learning.
Note: Oftentimes, you also have to apply to jobs online when you attend these events
   * Reach out via LinkedIn/Email/etc.
Pros: Reaching out electronically is a great way to quickly make contact with the right person. If done politely, this method is one of the most effective ways to recruit. If possible, reach out to Michigan alumni or people you have mutual connections with. Personalizing your message can increase your chances as well.
Cons: This method can be hit or miss depending on how often a person checks LinkedIn or if they’re in a good mood or not. Even if they do read your message, they may not be too invested in you as a candidate (a great reason to use LinkedIn which allows a recruiter to easily see your qualifications)


   4. Mock Interview (PD Big or Upperclassman in your Major) - due 11/17
Decide what company and role you would like to do a mock interview for, and notify the person you are doing the interview with of this. We suggest you select something you have researched in this process. You may choose to do any type of interview including, but not limited to, behavioral interviews, technical interviews/case studies, or super-day interviews. Talk with your PD Big/upperclassman in your major to determine which type of interview would be the most beneficial for you. Set up and complete an interview with a PD Big or upperclassman in your major. 
   5. 4 year plan (PD Big) - due 11/24
Making your class schedule early and thinking about how you want to organize your college semesters is very important. In this step you will be meeting with your PD big to create a schedule.
   6. LinkedIn (PD Chair or PD Big) – due 1 week after LinkedIn Workshop 11/11
Whether or not you already have a LinkedIn, keeping it up to date and ensuring that it is professional is extremely important. It can help you in the recruiting process and allow you to showcase your professional experience, skills, and achievements. PD will be putting on a LinkedIn workshop, which you should all attend. After this, you can meet with your PD Big or anybody on PD and get your LinkedIn approved.
   7. Alumni Panel (PD Chair)- due day of Alumni Panel
The Professional Development committee will be hosting an alumni panel, showcasing Theta Tau alum who now work in a variety of different industries. One of the best ways to learn is from other people who have already done what you are doing, so come to the panel and ask alum any questions you may have about their time at Michigan, their transition into full time, their company, or anything else you may want to know! You will be asked to submit questions to the PD committee ahead of time.








A reminder that your professional development does not end with your pledge semester, but instead continues throughout your time as a brother and throughout your whole career. Don't be afraid to ask for advice, critique, or feedback from brothers regularly - whether they're a member of PD or not, anyone in Theta Tau should be able to help you. By the end of your pledge semester, you should be connected with all brothers on LinkedIn and be comfortable asking any of them for professional advice. 
________________
E-Board Positions:


We will be holding a vote at the next pledge meeting (2/18) to determine who will represent the pledge E-Board!
   * Regent: Similar to the regent of the chapter as a whole, your role will be to oversee all pledge operations. You should have a general understanding of the status of all pledge projects and events so that we may approach you with any questions. You should be able to show strong leadership skills and keep the pledge class on track.
   * Treasurer: Your role will be to keep track of all of the funds that have been allocated to the pledge class. You should keep a running budget document and help divide funds in an appropriate manner. 
   * Cor Sec: Your role will be to stand up in front of the chapter at open chapter and relay to them all of the information that the pledge class has learned from the study guide, and what the status of the pledge project is. You will also be expected to write up this recap and send it out (in the form of a Weekly Update) to the rest of the chapter.

Pledge Projects: 
Foreword: Hi lovely nieces and nephews!! Your Auntie Arielle and Uncle Rohan are so excited to introduce your pledge projects to you. To give you some context about why these projects are part of your pledge requirements, we wanted to give you the opportunity to collaborate with each other to create content that commemorates/celebrates your pc and gives back to the brotherhood. Your Uncies will serve as your main points of contact for all of these projects, but it is always a good idea to reach out to the other brother contacts given to make sure your projects are the best they can possibly be. Your projects are what you put into them, so if you all chose to do the bare minimum, that’s fine, but we want to challenge you to have fun with it and show your individual creativity. We are sharing the project details with you now so you can begin to think about which projects call out to you, but Rohan and Arielle will be setting up a meeting soon to discuss subcommittee organization and to answer all of your questions.
